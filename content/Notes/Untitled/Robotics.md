2.3 Wheeled Mobile Robots The wheel has been by far the most popular locomotion mechanism in mobile robotics and in man-made vehicles in general.  
  
In addition, balance is not usually a research problem in wheeled robot designs, because wheeled robots are almost always designed so that all wheels are in ground contact at all times.  
  
Thus, three wheels are sufficient to guarantee stable balance, although, as we shall see below, two-wheeled robots can also be stable.  
  
When more than three wheels are used, a suspension system is required to allow all wheels to maintain ground contact when the robot encounters uneven terrain.  
  
Instead of worrying about balance, wheeled robot research tends to focus on the problems of traction and stability, maneuverability, and control: can the robot wheels provide Locomotion a) 31 b) c) Swedish 90° d) Swedish 45° Swedish 45° Figure 2.19 The four basic wheel types.  
  
(a) Standard wheel: two degrees of freedom; rotation around the (motorized) wheel axle and the contact point.  
  
(b) castor wheel: two degrees of freedom; rotation around an offset steering joint.  
  
(c) Swedish wheel: three degrees of freedom; rotation around the (motorized) wheel axle, around the rollers, and around the contact point.  
  
sufficient traction and stability for the robot to cover all of the desired terrain, and does the robot’s wheeled configuration enable sufficient control over the velocity of the robot?  
  
2.3.1 Wheeled locomotion: the design space As we shall see, there is a very large space of possible wheel configurations when one considers possible techniques for mobile robot locomotion.  
  
We begin by discussing the wheel in detail, as there are a number of different wheel types with specific strengths and weaknesses.  
  
Then, we examine complete wheel configurations that deliver particular forms of locomotion for a mobile robot.
